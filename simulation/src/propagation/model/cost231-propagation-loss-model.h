 *  \brief The COST-Hata-Model is the most often cited of the COST 231 models.
 *
 *  Also called the Hata Model PCS Extension, it is a radio propagation model
 *  that extends the Hata Model (which in turn is based on the Okumura Model)
 *  to cover a more elaborated range of frequencies. COST (COperation
 *  europï¿½enne dans le domaine de la recherche Scientifique et Technique)
 *  is a European Union Forum for cooperative scientific research which has
 *  developed this model accordingly to various experiments and researches.
 *  This model is applicable to urban areas. To further evaluate Path Loss
 *  in Suburban or Rural Quasi-open/Open Areas.
 *  Frequency: 1500 MHz to 2000 MHz
 *  Mobile Station Antenna Height: 1 up to 10m
 *  Base station Antenna Height: 30m to 200m
 *  Link Distance:up to 20 km
