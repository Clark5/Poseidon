 * duplex RS-232 or RS-422 with null modem and no handshaking.  There is no
 * multi-drop capability on this channel -- there can be a maximum of two 
 * point-to-point net devices connected.
 *
 * There are two "wires" in the channel.  The first device connected gets the
 * [0] wire to transmit on.  The second device gets the [1] wire.  There is a
 * state (IDLE, TRANSMITTING) associated with each wire.
