/**
 * \brief Global routing protocol for IP version 4 stacks.
 *
 * In ns-3 we have the concept of a pluggable routing protocol.  Routing
 * protocols are added to a list maintained by the Ipv4L3Protocol.  Every 
 * stack gets one routing protocol for free -- the Ipv4StaticRouting routing
 * protocol is added in the constructor of the Ipv4L3Protocol (this is the 
 * piece of code that implements the functionality of the IP layer).
 *
 * As an option to running a dynamic routing protocol, a GlobalRouteManager
 * object has been created to allow users to build routes for all participating
 * nodes.  One can think of this object as a "routing oracle"; it has
 * an omniscient view of the topology, and can construct shortest path
 * routes between all pairs of nodes.  These routes must be stored 
 * somewhere in the node, so therefore this class Ipv4GlobalRouting
 * is used as one of the pluggable routing protocols.  It is kept distinct
 * from Ipv4StaticRouting because these routes may be dynamically cleared
 * and rebuilt in the middle of the simulation, while manually entered
 * routes into the Ipv4StaticRouting may need to be kept distinct.
 *
 * This class deals with Ipv4 unicast routes only.
 *
 * \see Ipv4RoutingProtocol
 * \see GlobalRouteManager
