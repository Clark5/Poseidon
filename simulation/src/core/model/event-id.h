 * with Simulator::Cancel or Simulator::Remove.

 * every variable of this type is _always_ in a valid state, 
 * even when it has not been assigned an EventId coming from a Schedule
 * method: calling Cancel, IsRunning, IsExpired or passing around
 * instances of this object will not result in crashes or memory leaks.
