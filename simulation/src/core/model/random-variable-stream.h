 *
 * \brief ns-3 random numbers are provided via instances of
 * ns3::RandomVariableStream.
 *
 * - By default, ns-3 simulations use a fixed seed; if there is any
 *   randomness in the simulation, each run of the program will yield
 *   identical results unless the seed and/or run number is changed.
 * - In ns-3.3 and earlier, ns-3 simulations used a random seed by default;
 *   this marks a change in policy starting with ns-3.4.
 * - In ns-3.14 and earlier, ns-3 simulations used a different wrapper
 *   class called ns3::RandomVariable.  This implementation is documented
 *   above under Legacy Random Variables. As of ns-3.15, this class has 
 *   been replaced by ns3::RandomVariableStream; the underlying 
 *   pseudo-random number generator has not changed.
 * - To obtain randomness across multiple simulation runs, you must
 *   either set the seed differently or set the run number differently.
 *   To set a seed, call ns3::RngSeedManager::SetSeed() at the beginning
 *   of the program; to set a run number with the same seed, call 
 *   ns3::RngSeedManager::SetRun() at the beginning of the program.
 * - Each RandomVariableStream used in ns-3 has a virtual random number 
 *   generator associated with it; all random variables use either 
 *   a fixed or random seed based on the use of the global seed. 
 * - If you intend to perform multiple runs of the same scenario, 
 *   with different random numbers, please be sure to read the manual 
 *   section on how to perform independent replications.

 * \brief The Weibull distribution Random Number Generator (RNG) that allows stream numbers to be set deterministically.
 *
 * This class supports the creation of objects that return random numbers
 * from a fixed Weibull distribution.  It also supports the generation of
 * single random numbers from various Weibull distributions.
 *
 * The probability density function is defined over the interval [0, \f$+\infty\f$]
 * as: \f$ \frac{k}{\lambda}\left(\frac{x}{\lambda}\right)^{k-1}e^{-\left(\frac{x}{\lambda}\right)^k} \f$
 * where \f$ k > 0\f$ is the shape parameter and \f$ \lambda > 0\f$  is the scale parameter. The
 * specified mean is related to the scale and shape parameters by the following relation:
 * \f$ mean = \lambda\Gamma\left(1+\frac{1}{k}\right) \f$ where \f$ \Gamma \f$ is the Gamma function.
 *
 * Since Weibull distributions can theoretically return unbounded values,
 * it is sometimes useful to specify a fixed upper limit.  Note however
 * when the upper limit is specified, the true mean of the distribution
 * is slightly smaller than the mean value specified.
 *
 * Here is an example of how to use this class:
 * \code
 *   double scale = 5.0;
 *   double shape = 1.0;
 * 
 *   Ptr<WeibullRandomVariable> x = CreateObject<WeibullRandomVariable> ();
 *   x->SetAttribute ("Scale", DoubleValue (scale));
 *   x->SetAttribute ("Shape", DoubleValue (shape));
 * 
 *   // The expected value for the mean of the values returned by a
 *   // Weibull distributed random variable is
 *   //
 *   //     E[value]  =  scale * Gamma(1 + 1 / shape)  ,
 *   //               
 *   // where Gamma() is the Gamma function.  Note that 
 *   //               
 *   //     Gamma(n)  =  (n - 1)!
 *   //               
 *   // if n is a positive integer.
 *   //
 *   // For this example,
 *   //
 *   //     Gamma(1 + 1 / shape)  =  Gamma(1 + 1 / 1)
 *   //                           =  Gamma(2)
 *   //                           =  (2 - 1)!
 *   //                           =  1
 *   //
 *   // which means
 *   //
 *   //     E[value]  =  scale  .
 *   //

 * (RNG) that allows stream numbers to be set deterministically.
 *
 * This class supports the creation of objects that return random numbers
 * from a fixed log-normal distribution.  It also supports the generation of
 * single random numbers from various log-normal distributions.
 *
 * LogNormalRandomVariable defines a random variable with a log-normal
 * distribution.  If one takes the natural logarithm of random
 * variable following the log-normal distribution, the obtained values
 * follow a normal distribution.
 *
 * The probability density function is defined over the interval [0,\f$+\infty\f$) as:
 * \f$ \frac{1}{x\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(ln(x) - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}\f$
 * where \f$ mean = e^{\mu+\frac{\sigma^2}{2}} \f$ and
 * \f$ variance = (e^{\sigma^2}-1)e^{2\mu+\sigma^2}\f$
 *
 * The \f$ \mu \f$ and \f$ \sigma \f$ parameters can be calculated instead if
 * the mean and variance are known with the following equations:
 * \f$ \mu = ln(mean) - \frac{1}{2}ln\left(1+\frac{variance}{mean^2}\right)\f$, and,
 * \f$ \sigma = \sqrt{ln\left(1+\frac{variance}{mean^2}\right)}\f$
 *
 * Here is an example of how to use this class:
 * \code
 *   double mu = 5.0;
 *   double sigma = 2.0;
 *   
 *   Ptr<LogNormalRandomVariable> x = CreateObject<LogNormalRandomVariable> ();
 *   x->SetAttribute ("Mu", DoubleValue (mu));
 *   x->SetAttribute ("Sigma", DoubleValue (sigma));
 *   
 *   // The expected value for the mean of the values returned by a
 *   // log-normally distributed random variable is equal to 
 *   //
 *   //                             2
 *   //                   mu + sigma  / 2
