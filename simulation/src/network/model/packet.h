/**
 * \ingroup packet
 * \brief network packets
 *
 * Each network packet contains a byte buffer, a set of byte tags, a set of
 * packet tags, and metadata.
 *
 * - The byte buffer stores the serialized content of the headers and trailers 
 * added to a packet. The serialized representation of these headers is expected
 * to match that of real network packets bit for bit (although nothing
 * forces you to do this) which means that the content of a packet buffer
 * is expected to be that of a real packet.
 *
 * - The metadata describes the type of the headers and trailers which
 * were serialized in the byte buffer. The maintenance of metadata is
 * optional and disabled by default. To enable it, you must call
 * Packet::EnablePrinting and this will allow you to get non-empty
 * output from Packet::Print. If you wish to only enable
 * checking of metadata, and do not need any printing capability, you can
 * call Packet::EnableChecking: its runtime cost is lower than
 * Packet::EnablePrinting.
 *
 * - The set of tags contain simulation-specific information which cannot
 * be stored in the packet byte buffer because the protocol headers or trailers
 * have no standard-conformant field for this information. So-called
 * 'byte' tags are used to tag a subset of the bytes in the packet byte buffer
 * while 'packet' tags are used to tag the packet itself. The main difference
 * between these two kinds of tags is what happens when packets are copied,
 * fragmented, and reassembled: 'byte' tags follow bytes while 'packet' tags
 * follow packets. Another important difference between these two kinds of tags
 * is that byte tags cannot be removed and are expected to be written once,
 * and read many times, while packet tags are expected to be written once,
 * read many times, and removed exactly once. An example of a 'byte' 
 * tag is a FlowIdTag which contains a flow id and is set by the application
 * generating traffic. An example of a 'packet' tag is a cross-layer 
 * qos class id set by an application and processed by a lower-level MAC 
 * layer.
 *
 * Implementing a new type of Header or Trailer for a new protocol is 
 * pretty easy and is a matter of creating a subclass of the ns3::Header 
 * or of the ns3::Trailer base class, and implementing the methods
 * described in their respective API documentation.
 *
 * Implementing a new type of Tag requires roughly the same amount of
 * work and this work is described in the ns3::Tag API documentation.
 *
 * The performance aspects of the Packet API are discussed in 
 * \ref packetperf

 * The current implementation of the byte buffers and tag list is based
 * on COW (Copy On Write. An introduction to COW can be found in Scott 
 * Meyer's "More Effective C++", items 17 and 29). What this means is that
 * copying packets without modifying them is very cheap (in terms of cpu
 * and memory usage) and modifying them can be also very cheap. What is 
 * key for proper COW implementations is being
 * able to detect when a given modification of the state of a packet triggers
 * a full copy of the data prior to the modification: COW systems need
 * to detect when an operation is "dirty".
 *
 * Dirty operations:
 *   - ns3::Packet::AddHeader
 *   - ns3::Packet::AddTrailer
 *   - both versions of ns3::Packet::AddAtEnd
 *   - ns3::Packet::RemovePacketTag
 *
 * Non-dirty operations:
 *   - ns3::Packet::AddPacketTag
 *   - ns3::Packet::PeekPacketTag
 *   - ns3::Packet::RemoveAllPacketTags
 *   - ns3::Packet::AddByteTag
 *   - ns3::Packet::FindFirstMatchingByteTag
 *   - ns3::Packet::RemoveAllByteTags
 *   - ns3::Packet::RemoveHeader
 *   - ns3::Packet::RemoveTrailer
 *   - ns3::Packet::CreateFragment
 *   - ns3::Packet::RemoveAtStart
 *   - ns3::Packet::RemoveAtEnd
 *   - ns3::Packet::CopyData
 *
 * Dirty operations will always be slower than non-dirty operations,
 * sometimes by several orders of magnitude. However, even the
 * dirty operations have been optimized for common use-cases which
 * means that most of the time, these operations will not trigger
 * data copies and will thus be still very fast.
